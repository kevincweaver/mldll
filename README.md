windows library for optimized machine learning matrix operations

This repository contains cpp implementations of various optimized matrix operations as a learning exercise during the completion of a course in computer architecture.
It consists of a windows dynamic link library and a python script that can call the fuctions using the ctypes module.

Sources for some of the strategies implemented include:
